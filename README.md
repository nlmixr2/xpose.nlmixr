The goal of `xpose.nlmixr` is to provide an extension to `xpose` to
support `nlmixr`. The package provides functions to import `nlmixr`
fit data into an `xpose` data object, allowing the use of `xpose` for
`nlmixr` model diagnostics.

The excellent `xpose` package can be found
[here](https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/xpose), and is a
prerequisite for using `xpose.nlmixr`.
